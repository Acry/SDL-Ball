## Playfield borders

- [ ] new global theme description files
  I deleted the playfield border-test, that was not clever, it was there for a reason.
  I was working towards dynamic borders, e.g. dropping levels.
  Also, a theme should define the playfield border, so it can be different for each theme.
  Arkanoid needs a smaller playfield.
  We can add theme meta data, like enemies, true/false and different difficulties.
  Life, Ballspeed, Ball size, Paddle size, etc. are all theme related.
  describes the theme, author, version, etc.
