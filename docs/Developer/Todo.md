## Additional things

### Gameplay

- [ ] setting titleScreenShow ?

- [ ] a - restart level
- [ ] r - random level
- [ ] n - next level
- [ ] m - previous level
- [ ] f - autoplay

- [ ] Make the game playable without datafiles (random levels, no samplers)
- [ ] LevelManager - random level
- [ ] simple GPU-Sounds?
- [ ] mod support for music and samples
- [X] make game playable with keys
- [ ] MenuManager
- [ ] change difficulty in Menu
- [ ] normal Ball spritesheet - Themes: classic/retro/arkanoid/3.1
- [ ] rework positional sound <https://examples.libsdl.org/SDL3/audio/05-planar-data/>
- [ ] modernize game controllers, see: https://examples.libsdl.org/SDL3/input/01-joystick-polling/

Themes

- [Arkanoid ](Themes/Araknoid.md) smalle playfield
- Retro [Theme](Themes/Retro.md)

#### Tracer

- [ ] Tracer, to EffectManager
- [ ] tracer shows red color and shows up when glued to the paddle, should reset in new level
- [ ] is tracer speed dependent on the speed of the ball?
- [ ] Tracer, if Ball explosive, make Tracer more orange and dont use Colors of bricks bounced to.
- [ ] Tracer refactoring (effectManager/eventManager/inheritance/particleSystem/consistent naming, from LevelTheme to
  instance)
  Named: Tail, Tracer, BallEffect, BallTracer, BallTail ...
  public: tracer tail; - andersrum w√§re richtig gewesen. Tracer ist eine Form des Ball-Tails
- [ ] Tracer, inherit from growable
- [X] Tracer, inherit from MovingObject

### Auxiliary

- [ ] use OpenGL debug callbacks
- [X] I broke the screenshot feature after extraction. Might be a threading issue.
  Not sure, think it was because the method was static
- [ ] ScreenshotManager with UI?
- [ ] use player name from config
- [ ] savegame folder, use textfile instead of binary
- [ ] fix speedometer
- [ ] fix messed up values due to [projection change](OpenGL/Projection.md).
- [ ] use sdl2 high performance timer, see: [Timing](Physics%20&%20Timing/Timing.md)
- [ ] Refactor [Timing](Refactoring/Timing.md)
- [ ] show current level no# during gameplay
- [ ] separate Powerup Descriptions from Title, new Scene
- [ ] open website from title screen
- [ ] add a new scene for the used keys
- [ ] add a new scene for more explanation, see Website page=about.html
- [ ] autoplay after title for a while
- [ ] autosave level on quit, asked for continuing
- [ ] hot reload themes/levels/graphics/sounds
- [ ] polish Leveleditor
- [ ] using a physics engine at this point might be overkill.
- [ ] add a pause indicator / Pause Scene
- [ ] rework the shop
- [ ] https://examples.libsdl.org/SDL3/demo/04-bytepusher/

- [X] implement callbacks (EventManager)

- [ ] use shaders
- [ ] use SDL 3, not sure if I should maintain SDL2 plus Emscripten
- [ ] Emscripten
- [ ] ThemeManager zu cmdline, um Themes zu validieren

### Source Structure

- [ ] move all GameObjects to GameObjects folder
- [ ] move all Managers to Manager folder
- [ ] move all Scenes to Scene folder

### Tests

- [ ] Makefile is getting huge, clion has already problems
- [X] write used keys as help, with TextManager, if graphics are available

- [X] separate manual tests from automatic tests
- [ ] write automatic tests
- [ ] add Theme fixtures to tests
- [ ] add saveGames fixtures to tests
