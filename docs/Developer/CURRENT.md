- [X] rethink collision (paddle collision points)
  Mixed approach for now, on collision in GameObjectManagers
  no convex paddle for now, just a simple rectangle, set angle
- [ ] Paddle/PaddleManager real implementations in src
- [ ] EffectManager.md
- [ ] Collision.md
- [ ] PowerupManager
- [ ] Powerups
- [ ] Gun
- [ ] Tracer

Paddle-Spawn, Paddle Despawn - on level completed, Paddle explode

## Connect the dots:

- [ ] GameManager.md
- [ ] CodeManager.md
- [ ] SceneManager.md

run codeManager (setup game), run sceneManager, (simple menuManager?) run gameManager

scene 1-2 for ten seconds, autoplay, then scene 3-4 for ten seconds, autoplay, then scene 5,6 for ten seconds, autoplay

images instead of scenes 1-6

ScoreManager
HudManager

MenuManager, HighScoreManager, SaveGameManager

PlayGame: key, or movement brings up Want to play Game? hides after 5 seconds
