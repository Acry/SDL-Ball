# OOP vs Functional Programming

## OOP

OOP is and has always been broken by design.
Classes are factories. which are barely needed.
OOP is an end in itself, totally abstracted to implement the blueprint of the blueprint.
I dont want that, oh, make it singleton, make it a class, make it a factory, make it a template, make it a lambda, make
it a function, make it a macro.
I want to write code, not classes or templates.
Yeah, and encapsulation protects a class of a coder. =)
Inheritenace, Polymorphism - like dependencies: gorilla - banana.

"Object-oriented programming is an exceptionally bad idea which could only have originated in California."

That said, happy hacking.

## Functional Programming

P.S.

Functional programming is not about lambdas, it is all about pure functions.

So broadly promote functional style:

- Only use function arguments, do not use global state.
- Keep
- Minimise side effects.

This can be achieved in plain c, no need for magic.

Use the constructor for dependency injection, but don't overdo it.
