# Development - Get started

I highly doubt anyone will pick this up; nowadays nobody likes to do things without payment.
It is a fun project and a nice game, the refactoring is challenging.
Don't want to end this up as yet another broken 2D game engine.

If you are kinda experienced, you can refactor the [managers](Managers.md).
I started to write tests for the managers, [Refactoring](Todo.md##Refactoring).

The game will be unplayable for a while, most importantly is that `make tests` works, before commiting.
Those are not programmable tests, but they are a good start.

For smaller Todos check out [Todo](Todo.md). You need a running branch for that.

Thank you, Jimmy Christensens for writing this game and sharing it with the world.
