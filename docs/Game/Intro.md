## Clean Sweep

Clean Sweep is a seminal block breaker video game developed and published by Ramtek for the arcade in May 1974.
The game uses TTL instead of a CPU and is among the first video games to use RAM to store the game state and ROM to
store graphics.

### Ramtek History

Ramtek Corporation was a California-based company founded on September 4, 1971, by engineers Charles E. McEwan and John
W. Metzler, along with lawyer Jack Teeters. Initially focused on manufacturing computer display terminals, Ramtek's
primary business was in medical monitors and high-end graphical terminals for industrial and academic use. The company
was established after McEwan and Metzler, who had previously worked together at the computer graphics division of Data
Disc, Inc., and the Western Design Labs division of Philco-Ford, sought to create devices for displaying computer system
information.

In 1973, Ramtek entered the coin-operated video game industry, inspired by the success of Atari’s Pong, which a group of
Ramtek engineers, including Pete Kauffman, observed at Andy Capp’s Tavern in Sunnyvale. This pivot came as the company
struggled with undercapitalization due to delayed payments from high-end corporate contracts. The video game market
offered a lucrative opportunity, and Ramtek became one of the earliest manufacturers of arcade video games, producing
coin-operated games until 1979.

Ramtek’s contributions to the video game industry were significant, particularly with games like Clean Sweep (May 1974),
a block breaker that predated Atari’s Breakout and used TTL circuitry, RAM for game state, and ROM for graphics. Other
notable titles included Knockout (1974), which sparked the ball-and-paddle pinball craze, Baseball (1974), one of the
earliest games with articulated human characters, and Trivia (1975), the first video game quiz machine. Baseball faced
production challenges due to heavy circuit boards but became a hit after being licensed to Midway Mfg. as Ball Park (
1975).

The company’s success in video games led to rapid growth, with 10,000 units sold in its first 18 months and 20,000 by
1976, making it one of the most successful video game companies of the era. However, the volatility of the arcade
market, especially after a 1974 market saturation of Pong clones, prompted Ramtek to diversify. In 1975, it acquired
Micro Machines and commercialized the MM 80, an Intel 8080 emulator, and began integrating microprocessors into its
graphics terminals. That same year, a fire at its Sunnyvale facility on 290 Commercial Ave. damaged manufacturing
operations, but a collective effort by employees and their families enabled recovery. By mid-1976, Ramtek relocated to
585 N Mary Ave.

Starting in 1974, Ramtek explored microprocessor technology, developing a prototype pinball machine called Lucky Dice
using an Intel 4040 microprocessor. Though it was shown privately in 1975, it never entered production due to technical
issues. The company also ventured into electro-mechanical games like Horoscope (1976) and Boom Ball (1977) but struggled
to keep pace with the increasingly competitive and technology-driven video game market by the late 1970s.

Ramtek went public in 1979 and was reported in 1981 as the leading company in raster graphics display terminals. Its
RM-3300 terminal appeared in the TV show Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, and later products included the 6214
Color-graphic Computer (1980) and the 2020-4228 CAD workstation (1985). Despite its early video game success, Ramtek’s
focus shifted back to graphical terminals, and its arcade game production ceased by 1979.

The company faced challenges from employee departures, notably Pete Kauffman, who left in late 1973 to found Exidy,
Inc., taking several Ramtek engineers, including Metzler and Howell Ivy, who contributed to Clean Sweep and Baseball.
Ramtek’s innovations, particularly in early video game technology, cemented its role as a pioneer in the industry,
influencing later developments despite its eventual exit from the arcade market.

## Breakout

Atari 2600, 1976

Breakout is an arcade video game developed and published by Atari, Inc. and released on May 13, 1976. Breakout was
released in Japanese arcades by Namco. The game was designed by Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow and prototyped via
discrete logic chips by Steve Wozniak with assistance from Steve Jobs.

In the game, eight rows of bricks line the top portion of the screen, and the player's goal is to destroy the bricks by
repeatedly bouncing a ball off a paddle into them. The concept was predated by Ramtek's Clean Sweep (1974), but the
game's designers were influenced by Atari's own Pong (1972).

The arcade version of Breakout uses a monochrome display underneath a translucent colored overlay.
