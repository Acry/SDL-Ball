## Clean Sweep

Clean Sweep is a seminal block breaker video game developed and published by Ramtek for the arcade in May 1974.
The game uses TTL instead of a CPU and is among the first video games to use RAM to store the game state and ROM to
store graphics.

Breakout is an arcade video game developed and published by Atari, Inc. and released on May 13, 1976. Breakout was
released in Japanese arcades by Namco. The game was designed by Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow and prototyped via
discrete logic chips by Steve Wozniak with assistance from Steve Jobs.

In the game, eight rows of bricks line the top portion of the screen, and the player's goal is to destroy the bricks by
repeatedly bouncing a ball off a paddle into them. The concept was predated by Ramtek's Clean Sweep (1974), but the
game's designers were influenced by Atari's own Pong (1972).

The arcade version of Breakout uses a monochrome display underneath a translucent colored overlay.
