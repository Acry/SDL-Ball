Quick rite up before I am probably gonna push a broken state.
I see that as a personal defeat, but I am running out of time.

If you are kinda experienced you can refactor the [managers](Managers.md).
For smaller Todos check out [](Todo.md). You need a running branch for that.

I doubt anyone will pick this up, nowadays nobody likes to do things without payment.
It is a fun project and a nice game, the refactoring was and is challenging.

I don't want to end this up as yet another broken 2D game engine.

Thank you, Jimmy Christensens for writing this game and sharing it with the world.
