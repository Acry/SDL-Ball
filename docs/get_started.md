# Development - Get started

Quickly write up before I am probably gonna push a broken state.
I see that as a personal defeat, but I am running out of time.

I highly doubt anyone will pick this up; nowadays nobody likes to do things without payment.
It is a fun project and a nice game, the refactoring was and is challenging.
Don't want to end this up as yet another broken 2D game engine.

If you are kinda experienced, you can refactor the [managers](Managers.md).
I started to write tests for the managers, [Refactoring](Todo.md##Refactoring), so I should be there in a couple of weekends.

For smaller Todos check out [Todo](Todo.md). You need a running branch for that.

Thank you, Jimmy Christensens for writing this game and sharing it with the world.
